## Notes:

### Recall
![[Pasted image 20250226155548.png]]
 - The Kernel is the set of all inputs into the linear map to gives the zero vector as an output
 - The Image is the set of all possible output vectors from applying the linear map to some input vector

- A linear map is considered a linear isomorphism if it is able to take all inputs from its codomain (i.e. $\mathbb{R}^n$)

- If in a finite dimension we can make any vector in the dimension from a linear combination / combination vector of a basis of the dimension

- If a subspace is isomorphic to another subspace then they are both isomorphic to each other

### Properties
![[Pasted image 20250226160828.png]]
- If the dimension of the input vector is reduced when put through a linear map then it is NOT Injective because all inputs will not map to a unique output
- If the dimension of the input vector is increased when put through a linear map then it is NOT surjective meaning that it can not map to all vectors in its output dimension
