## Notes:

### Linear Transformations / Linear Maps
- A linear map will take in vectors in a vector space V and map it onto another vector space W
- It will can also map vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ 
- A linear map T can also be considered or represented as a matrix A
- So $T(\vec{x})=A\vec{x}$ 

- There are two properties to be considered a linear map (We are representing the linear map as a matrix A)
1. $A(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=A\vec{u}+A\vec{v}$
2. $A(c\vec{u})=c(A\vec{u})$

#### Matrix Representation of Linear Maps
- Linear Maps can be represented as matrixes that would be multiplied to:
1. stretch/squish a coordinate system
2. reflect/rotate a coordinate system
3. shifting a coordinate system

### Dot Product

- When multiplying matrixes reversing the order will not result in the same matrix being produced
- Also if a matrix multiplication results in a zero that does NOT imply that either of the matrixes being multiplied are equal to zero

- To get the product you multiply the rows of A with the columns of B to get the value that lies where the rows and columns intercept
