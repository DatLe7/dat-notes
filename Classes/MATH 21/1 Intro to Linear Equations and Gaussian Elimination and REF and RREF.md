### Gaussian Elimination and Row Echelon Form
![[Pasted image 20250106164657.png]] 
- The leading variables must also have a coefficient of 1
- Ex: Would be in row echelon form because x1 is not in the linear equations of x2 and x3. x2 is also not in the linear equation of x3. It is also in row echelon form as the leading variables have a coefficient of 1$$
\begin{vmatrix}
x_{1}+2x_{2}+5x_{3}\\
x_{2}+3x_{3}\\
x_{3}\\
\end{vmatrix}
$$
Converting system of equations into matrix form
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
1 2 5 \\
0 1 3 \\
0 0 1
\end{vmatrix}
$$
### Row Echelon Form(REF) vs Reduced Row Echelon Form(RREF)

- RREF is Row Echelon Form but all of the leading/pivoting variables must be the only non-zero value
