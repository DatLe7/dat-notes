- If a linear map translates to the same dimension then if it is injective or surjective then it is bijective

### Matrix Representation of a Linear Map

- We find the matrix representation of a linear transformation by doing a change of basis from 
  V->W

- Using the change of basis matrix you can find the coordinate vector for any vector in respect to basis B by multiplying the change of basis matrix by the coordinate vector of the vector in respect to the basis A

### Examples

EX 2
- To do a change of Basis on a linear map
- We first take all basis vectors in the dim. of the input 
- We then take the outputs from all the basis vectors
- We then find their coordinate vector with respect to the Basis of the output dimension
- We combine those coordinate vectors into a matrix to get the change of basis of the Linear Map
