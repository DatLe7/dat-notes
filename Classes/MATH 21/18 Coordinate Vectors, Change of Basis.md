## Notes:
### Change of Basis

- We can set this problem up as $A\vec{x}=b$ problem and find to find the a,b,c values that make up the coordinate vector

### Linear Maps

### Examples
![[Pasted image 20250223125120.png]]
- Same as checking if maps were linear before just in different abstract vector spaces

![[Pasted image 20250223125508.png]]
- A linear map must always be able to map to the zero vector

### Kernel(Null Space) and Image(Range)
![[Pasted image 20250223130115.png]]
 - The Kernel is the set of all inputs into the linear map to gives the zero vector as an output
 - The Image is the set of all possible output vectors from applying the linear map to some input vector

### Injective, Surjective, Bijective
![[Pasted image 20250223130423.png]]
- Injective means that each vector inputted into the linear map has one distinct output meaning there are no inputs that give the same output
- Surjective means that its set of all possible output vectors is the same its output dimension (i.e. it can output all vectors in its output dimension)
- Bijective means a linear map is both injective and surjective
