## Notes:
### Change of Basis

- We can set this problem up as $A\vec{x}=b$ problem and find to find the a,b,c values that make up the coordinate vector

### Linear Maps

### Examples

- Same as checking if maps were linear before just in different abstract vector spaces

- A linear map must always be able to map to the zero vector
