## Notes:

### Sets
A **set** is a collection of **elements** which are the things inside the set
- A set is expressed using commas and enclosed braces
i.e. $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$
- A set is considered to be an **infinite** set if it contains infinitely many elements
i.e. $\{ \dots,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,\dots \}$
- Otherwise the set is considered **finite** if it is not infinite

#### Equal Sets
- Two sets are considered **equal** if they contain the exact same elements
i.e. $\{ 1,3,4 \}=\{ 4,1,3 \}$
- The number of times an element is listed is irrelevant when considering if two sets are **equal**
i.e. $\{ 1,1,1,3 \}=\{ 3,3,1 \}$

#### Set Notation
- We use uppercase letters to stand for a set and a lowercase letter to represent a element in the set
i.e. $A=\{ 1,2,3 \}$ is the set and to represent an element we use $a\in A$ 
- We use $\in$ to say an element is in a set and we use $\not\in$ to say a element is not in a set
i.e. $A=\{ 1,2,3 \}$ we say $3\in A$ and that $5\not\in A$
- We can also say several things are in a set with the following notation
i.e. $A=\{ 1,2,3 \}$ we say $2,3\in A$

#### Types of Sets
- The set of **natural numbers** (i.e., positive whole numbers) is denoted by $\mathbb{N}$
$\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\dots \}$

- The set of **integers** is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$
$\mathbb{Z}=\{ \dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots \}$

- The set of all rational number is denoted by $\mathbb{Q}$
- The set of all **real number** is denoted by $\mathbb{R}$
- An empty set is denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{  \}$

### Cardinality
**Cardinality** is the number of elements a set has and is denoted as $|X|$ given X is a set
i.e. $X=\{ 1,2,3 \}$ then $|X|=3$ 
i.e. $A=\{ a,b,c,d,e \}$ then $|A|=5$
i.e. $|\emptyset| = 0$ 
i.e. $Z=\{ \emptyset \}$ then $|Z|=1$, this is because Z is a set containing the empty set, meaning it contains one element that being the empty set

### Set Builder
A special notation called **set-builder notation** is used to describe sets that are too big or complex to list between braces.
- Consider the infinite set of all even integers $E=\{ \dots,-4,-2,0,2,4,\dots \}$. In set builder notation this set can be written as $E=\{ 2n:n\in \mathbb{Z} \}$ 
- We read the first brace as “the set of all things of form,” and the colon as “such that.”
- So the idea is E is the set of all possible values are 2n where n takes all the values from the set $\mathbb{Z}$

- In general, a set X written in set-builder notation has the syntax of
$X=\{ \exp ression:rule \}$
- You can also you $|$ instead of $:$ it means the same thing

- The same set can be written in many different ways
i.e. $\{ 2n|n\in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is the same as $\{ n\in \mathbb{Z}|n \;is\;even \}$

**Example**
Describe the set $A=\{ 7a+3b|a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \}$
- A is a set of the form 7a + 3b given a and b are integers.
