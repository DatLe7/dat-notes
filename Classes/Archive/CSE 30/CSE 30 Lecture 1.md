## Notes:
- Magic Method (look up later)
- In python all attributes are public so you can access and mutate them without a method
- You want to check for validity and handle it in the constructor
- Assert: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp
### Enhanced for loop (dictionaries)
``` python
for item, amount in self.inventory.items():
	print(item, amount)
```
