- If a linear map translates to the same dimension then if it is injective or surjective then it is bijective
- If a matrix maps to the same dimension then if it is linearly independent/injective then it also spans the entirety of the codomain/surjective and vice versa

**Example:**

- We basically checked if it was linearly independent as the only way that the linear transformation maps to zero is when we input 0

### Matrix Representation of a Linear Map

- This is similar to how we found the matrix representation of other linear transformations
- As we put basis vectors through the linear transformation and found its coordinate vector with respect to its new dimension's basis
- We can then add those resulting vectors into a matrix and that is the representation
- We did not notice we did then when we found the matrix representation for the first time because the transformation's we did used the identity matrix's vectors as the basis

EX 3
- T is surjective as in its matrix form it is a spanning set meaning it can map to all vectors in the codomain
- dimKer=1 because the matrix form is linearly dependent so there will be one free variable
- This also means that T is NOT injective because there is a free variable
