- An eigenvector is a vector that when multiplied with a linear map results in a vector that is a scalar multiplication of the eigen vector. The scalar value is called the eigenvalue
- Works same way with a matrix A

- There can only be an many eigenvectors as there are amount of vectors in a basis/amount of pivot columns
