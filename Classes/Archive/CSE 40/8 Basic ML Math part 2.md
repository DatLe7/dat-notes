### Total Probability Rule
![[Pasted image 20250128155839.png]]
- If A has a 45% chance of happening then A has a 55% chance not to occur

### Probability of Disjunction (A or B)
![[Pasted image 20250128160000.png]]
- We are subtracting P(A&B) because they intersect so if we don't subtract, the area would have been accounted for twice

### Bayes' Rule

#### Example
![[Pasted image 20250128160322.png]]
- We are able to calculate the chance of having meningitis if you have a sore neck without having to survey that information

### Random Variables
![[Pasted image 20250128160648.png]]
- x is an outcome
- p(x) is the probability of that outcome (ranging from 0 to 1)
