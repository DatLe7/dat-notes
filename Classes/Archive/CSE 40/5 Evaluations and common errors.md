## Notes:

### Error Estimation
*Common Approach*
- Split your available data into a training set and a test set
- Use the training set for finding the best hypothesis
- Do error estimation on the test set

#### Estimating Error

- Fancy term for this is: out-of-sample error

- When training we want to have a model that fits the training data well enough, but the most important thing is minimizing the estimated error on unseen data that was not used to build the model
