### Preface:
Let’s start by telling the truth: machines don’t learn. What a typical “learning machine” does, is find a mathematical formula, which, when applied to a collection of inputs (called “training data”), produces the desired outputs. This mathematical formula also generates the correct outputs for most other inputs (distinct from the training data) on the condition that those inputs come from the same or a similar statistical distribution as the one the training data was drawn from.

### Categories of ML
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

#### Overview
- *Supervised* learning uses labeled examples of classes (types of things) to construct a classifier (model) that can make predictions about future objects.
- *Unsupervised* learning organizes and analyzes unlabeled observations to identify new categories or clusters.
- *Reinforcement* learning uses delayed feedback about actions performed in some environment to learn the value of actions taken in specific contexts.

#### Examples
- *Supervised learning*
  - Medical diagnosis: Identifying liver cancer cells from previously seen examples of cancerous and non-cancerous cells.
  - Personal assistants: Learning which meetings are most important and how long to allocate for each type of meeting.
- *Unsupervised learning*
  - Scientific discovery: Finding patterns of similarity in sky objects observed through a telescope.
  - Recommender systems: Identifying groups of products (or documents, or user) with similar attributes.
- *Reinforcement learning*
  - Autonomous driving: Learning to control a car under slippery conditions.
  - Smart power grid: Using supply and demand feedback to control power generation parameters.
