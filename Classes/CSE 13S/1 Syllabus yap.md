### Resources

Textbook: Kernighan and Ritchie, The **C** Programming Language_ (often referred to as "K&R")

Other useful books are available online through the library:

- Newham, _Learning the bash Shell_
- Mecklenburg, _Managing Projects with GNU Make_
- Hartl, _Learn Enough Developer Tools to be Dangerous_

### Course Description

Focuses on C programming, command line, shell programming, editors, debuggers, source code control, and other tools. Examines basic computer systems, algorithm design, and development, data types, and program structures. Develops understanding of process model, compile-link-execute build cycle, language-machine interface, memory, and data representation. Students cannot receive credit for CSE 13S, CSE 13E, and ECE 13. Course is 7 credits with integrated laboratory.

### Grading

- 10% Section ("Lab") Attendance, lowest two scores dropped.
- 45% Wednesday Programming Assignments, submitted on canvas.
- 18% Friday Quizzes, in class, on paper, lowest two scores dropped, no make-up quizzes.
- 27% Final Exam, in class, on paper.

The Final Canvas score is converted to a grade using the table below.

SETS is a student survey about your experience taking this course. **If the SETS survey response rate is ≥ 75%**, then I'll use the percentages in the right column. (If there also is an ALEEC survey, which serves a different purpose, then the target is an _**average**_ participation of 75%. For example, 78% in SETS and 72% in ALEEC, for an average of 75%.)

If you have questions about programming assignment grades, talk to your assigned grader **first.**

- Link to regrade form (TBD)

#### Missed Quizzes:

- If you miss a quiz: No makeups. That quiz will be dropped (up to two).
- If you will miss a quiz for a school sanctioned event: See Dr. Veenstra in advance. Alternative arrangements will be made.
- If you miss a quiz due to an emergency: See Dr. Veenstra. Exceptions can be made on a case by case basis.

#### Late assignments:

- All assignments are due at 11:30PM on Wednesday unless otherwise specified.
- Assignments have a 29-minute grace period with no penalty.
- You will get 3 Grace days per quarter. You may use them on any assignment, and will not receive a late penalty. Any amount of time (even 2 seconds) into a calendar day will use a grace day. 
- Grace days are assigned programmatically (using Dr. Veenstra's Python script) to maximize your course grade.
- If you have an emergency (see Dr. Veenstra) or make a prior arrangement, you will not use grace days.

For example:

- Let's say that an assignment is due at 11:30 PM on Wednesday . . .
- If you submit the assignment at 11:59 PM on Wednesday that uses zero grace days (because there are 29 "grace minutes").
- But if you submit the assignment at 12:05 AM on Thursday that uses one grace day.
- And if you submit the assignment at 12:31 AM on Friday that uses two grace days. 

### Cheating

• Using code that you did not write is cheating,  
• First offense: zero on the assignment/quiz/test  
• Second offense: Fail the class

####   
• TAs and Tutors should not be giving out C code (they get in trouble, not you). If you receive any help from a TA/Tutor, cite it to avoid further complications. You will not get penalized for anything you get from a tutor or a TA if you cite it.

#### Examples of Prohibited Activity

- You may not work on your assignment with anyone.
- You may not show your code or design to anyone.
- You may not have anyone “walk you through” an assignment, describe a solution in detail, or sit with you as you work on it.
- This includes hired tutors, or if you personally pay the class tutors.
- You may not post code from your project on-line in questions when you ask others for help.
- You may not hire someone to write your code for you.
- This list is not exhaustive. Don't Cheat.

### DRC

- If you need DRC accommodations for anything, email [drc@ucsc.edu](mailto:drc@ucsc.edu).
