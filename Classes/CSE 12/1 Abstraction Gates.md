- Computers communicate in binary (i.e. through series of 1s and 0s)

- A terminal is like an element in the circuit like resistor or switch
- Node is like the wires that link the circuit together
![[Pasted image 20250122192722.png]]
- Switches in series means AND
- Switches in parallel mean OR
![[Pasted image 20250122192811.png]]
- This allows for their to be a margin of error incase of noise that would degrade the signal

- NMOS and PMOS transistors are opposites of each other
![[Pasted image 20250122192949.png]]
- NMOS logic uses a pull up resistor and only uses NMOS transistors for the pull down network
- CMOS logic uses PMOS transistors for the pull up and NMOS transistors for pull down
### Pros and Cons
- NMOS logic is more simple but it utilizes more power
- CMOS logic is more complex but uses less power
- This is because of the pull up resistor

- CMOS logic will always create NAND and NOR so to make AND and OR we put an inverter to the input
