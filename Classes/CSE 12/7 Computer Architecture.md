### Von Neumann Model
![[Pasted image 20250224144137.png]]
1. A **processing unit** with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
2. A **control unit** that includes an **instruction register** and **a program counter**
3. **Memory** that **stores data** and **instructions**
4. External **mass storage**
5. **Input and output** mechanisms

### What is a Program
**Program**: A sequence of individual instructions aimed at
collectively executing a specific task, e.g. find the largest
number in a set, find out how many times the word “happy”
appears in some text, etc...
❑ It is the basic operating principle for every computer.
❑ It is so common that it is taken for granted.
❑ Without it, every instruction would have to be initiated manually.


### Instructions
Each instruction is a sequence of 1s and 0s (remember a computer cant understand
except for logic High or Low)
• In RISC-V, the length of this sequence is fixed. It is 32 bits

### Taxonomy of Instruction Set Models
![[Pasted image 20250224144905.png]]

### CISC vs RISC
![[Pasted image 20250224144921.png]]
CISC uses variable instruction size
RISC uses fixed instruction size

### Solid State Memory

### DRAM
![[Pasted image 20250224145021.png]]DRAM have desctructive reads requiring immediate refresh of value read.
DRAMs transistors have leakage thus requiring periodic cell refresh.

### Static Rams for Register Arrays
