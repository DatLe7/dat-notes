### DeMorgan's Law
![[Pasted image 20250122193842.png]]
- In CMOS logic the pull up network is the DeMorgan's law version of the pull down network
### Bubble Pushing

- If a gate is inverted you can apply DeMorgan's law to it making its inputs inverted and changing it from a AND to an OR or vice versa
- You can observe than the inputs from the AND gate are being inverted twice so we can just remove both the inverters
- ALSO THEY ARE ALL NAND GATES, the last one is just a NAND gate with DeMorgan's law

- Series means AND
- Parallel means OR
- PMOS also means INVERTED INPUT
