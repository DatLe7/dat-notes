**Three Different Kinds of Reasoning
1. Deductive
2. Inductive
3. Abductive

### Deductive Reasoning
- a logical process that involves starting with general ideas and drawing specific conclusions. It's also known as deductive logic or top-down reasoning
- In deductive reasoning, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true if the original premises are true.
