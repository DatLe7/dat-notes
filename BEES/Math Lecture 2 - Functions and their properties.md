## Notes

- Functions take an input and determines one unique output value (not two different outputs, only one unique one)
- domain is all possible x values of a function
- range is all possible y values of a function
- Infinity is NOT a number

### Continuity
- Limit of x -> must equal f(c)
- Both the limit of x->c and f(c) must exist
- If there is a point c that that breaks the two rules then their is a discontinuity there
